    Envelope analysis apply modulation-demodulation tech on vibration data where the high resonance frequency modulate local faulty frequency data,
    after applying noise data filtering, and then using envelope method to extarct high frequency data off, we get faulty frequenct data. And that is 
    what we want to use to analyse the faulty thing
